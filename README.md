pugnation
=========

All the files to pugnation. This also has a webhook to auto update the site on commit.


To add more images create a pull request and then open the the Image.js file

Once you havefound the array with all the image links:
1. Add a comma to the end of the last link.
2. Add a new line.
3. Add your link in "" marks and then leave it at that if you are only adding one link.
4. Otherwise repeat the same steps.
5. Once complete, save the file.
6. Commit the change.
7. Push to the pull request.
8. I will confirm the changes and then merge the pull request.
